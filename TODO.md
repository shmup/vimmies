some shit I want to do

- move all language specific shit to its own branch
  - or devise something that makes my vim more usable for others (agnostic in many ways)
- consider fzy over fzf
- maybe group all shit in vimrc into relatable categories
  - meaning anything tab related goes in one group, etc
- make sure all my mappings are correct
  - check recursiveness etc
- update readme to emphasize things like:
  - don't forget to update submodules after you get latest from me
- work on my WHY.md to explain how i use some shit
